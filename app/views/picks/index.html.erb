            <p>Normally you wouldn’t put Bible Study, golf, art, and motorcycles together, but those are a few of the things I most enjoy.</p>
            <p>I love the Word of God and sharing the unsearchable riches of Christ with my people. I’m not a very good golfer and have learned to enjoy it in spite of my ineptitude.</p>
            <p>Art is another area in which my love exceeds my ability. I’ve done a few pieces that could never attain the standard I hold as to what constitutes "fine art". My Harley-Davidson is a 2001 Fatboy 1340 V-Twin, that I love to take out on sunny days and on short trips.</p>

                        <i>Divorce &amp; Remarriage</i>, by Guy Duty
                    </a>

                <span class="more">
                    The divorce issue became important to me years ago when the church I pastored held a view on the subject that alienated
                    divorced people and basically consigned them to second class status. I was forced to examine my own personal convictions
                    about divorce and remarriage. I sought advice and counsel from a man I highly respected and whose background and knowledge
                    on the subject qualified him to address the issue. He simply pointed me to Duty’s book and assured me that it would answer
                    my questions and help me settle my beliefs about divorce and remarriage. It did exactly that and if you want to know what
                    Jesus and the apostles taught about the subject then, by all means, get this book.

                        <i>Delighting in the Trinity</i>, by Michael Reeves
                    </a>
                </pTitle>
                <br />
                <span class="more">
                    I would say that most believers are unaware of the great importance the doctrine of the Trinity holds to the Christian
                    faith. Michael Reeves has done a wonderful job explaining the significance of the Trinity to our lives as Christians.
                    Far from being a dull theological treatise, this book will thrill your heart and impart a fresh appreciation of who God is.

                        <i>The Prodigal God</i>, by Timothy Keller
                    </a>
                </pTitle>
                <br />
                <span class="more">
                    Timothy Keller is considered by some as a modern day C.S. Lewis. I would concur with that assessment. Having read most of
                    what he has written, I can say that The Prodigal God is, hands down, my favorite. This is one of those books that opens your
                    eyes to see your relationship to God in a brand new way. <i>The Prodigal God</i> will plunge you into the ocean of God’s love and
                    immerse you in the depths of his grace such as you’ve never experienced.

                        <i>Knowing God</i>, by J.I. Packer
                    </a>
                </pTitle>
                <br />
                <span class="more">
                    Consider this book by the late J.I. Packer as a systematic theology whereby he formulates an orderly presentation of the God
                    of the Bible. Here you will discover the great difference between knowing about God and possessing true knowledge of him. I
                    would consider this Packer’s greatest contribution to his spiritual legacy. If, as Tozer says, the most important thing about
                    you is how you perceive God, then this book is a must read.

                        <i>Knowledge of the Holy</i>, by A.W. Tozer

                </pTitle>
                <br />
                <span class="more">
                    I have said before that if there was only one book besides the Bible that I could take with me to a deserted island, it would
                    be <i>Knowledge of the Holy</i>. It is as inspiring as it is informative. Considered by many to be one of the great
                    Christian classics, Knowledge of the Holy eloquently sets forth the majesty of God in his most glorious attributes. If you’re
                    like me, you will come to treasure this work and will return to it, again and again, to feed your soul.
